A basic Python To-Do List App
Stepwise Instructions
 
Step 1:Start

Step 2: Project Setup
Before beginning to code, it is crucial to establish your project environment. Launch your preferred code editor(whether it's Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, a basic text editor, or Google Colab), and initiate a new Python file. Choose a suitable name for the file, like "to-do list.py".

Step 3: A menu to the user to select
This menu will offer choices such as adding tasks, viewing tasks, marking tasks as done, and exit.

Step 4:functionality to include tasks in our to-do list
We will request the user for a description of the task and subsequently add it to the existing list of tasks.

Step 5:A function for observing the tasks listed in the to-do list 
This function will systematically go through the list, presenting each task along with its corresponding index.

Step 6:Enable users to indicate completion of tasks and subsequently eliminating them from the list.

Step 7: Integrating all components into the main program logic
This entails building a loop that showcases the menu, captures user input, and triggers the relevant functions in accordance with the user's selection.
Step 8: Enhance the durability of the to-do list by incorporating functionality to save and retrieve tasks from a file.

Step 9: End
